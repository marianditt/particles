# Particles

Toy project that investigates how to arrange a set of discs such that...

* ...each pair of particles have a minimum gap
* ...no ray of light in a certain range can pass through the cloud of particles

A particle is a disc in 2D with a given radius.
A ray of light cannot pass through the cloud if it intersects at least one disc.
